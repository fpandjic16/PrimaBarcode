 * and quieter than the scanner's decode beep that plays just before it, so the beep that says
 * "read" drowned out the one that says "look". The highest clean tone ToneGenerator has is 1200 Hz,
 * which Android uses for acknowledgement; the higher ones are telephony signals that sound
 * different from one manufacturer to the next.
 *
 * - **2–3 kHz** is where a handheld's small speaker is most efficient and the ear most sensitive,
 *   so it is the loudest sound a given volume setting can make. Same register as the scanner's
 *   beep; the falling pitch is what says "no".
 * - **Twice**, because one pair is easy to miss in a loud warehouse and a longer sound is heard as
 *   a louder one. About two thirds of a second — the warning dialog stops the operator anyway.
 *
 * Chosen on paper, not by ear on a device. These numbers are the place to tune it.
