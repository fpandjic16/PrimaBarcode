 * This is the whole of the per-user isolation. Every query in the app is scoped by
 * `(documentNo, type)` and nothing more, which is safe precisely because a query cannot reach
 * outside the file it runs in. Nobody filters by user; the file does it.
 *
 * **Never hold a DAO, or the database, in a field.** Read [current] at the moment of use, or
 * observe [database] and re-subscribe. A reference captured before a profile switch writes into
 * the previous operator's file — the one failure mode this design has, and it is silent.
