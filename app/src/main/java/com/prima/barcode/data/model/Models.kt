 * both `SHIPMENT`, retail receipt and warehouse receipt are both `RECEIPT` — so `Document_Type`
 * alone no longer identifies a bucket. Every download filter and every uploaded recording for
 * these four carries `Retail_Location` alongside the code to disambiguate.
 *
 * Null means the type doesn't participate: transport sheets, complaints and inventory each carry
 * their own `Document_Type` code, so there is nothing to disambiguate — they get no
 * `Retail_Location` clause on download nor the field on upload.
 *
 * [defaultFilterMode] is the scope a type falls back to until the user sets one in Settings.
 * Location suits the document types that move goods between two places; complaints are tracked
 * by responsibility centre instead.
