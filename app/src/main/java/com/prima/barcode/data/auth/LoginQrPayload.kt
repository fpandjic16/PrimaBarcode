/**
 * Credentials handed to the sign-in screen by a scanned QR code, so a handheld can be signed in
 * without typing a Windows password on a keypad.
 *
 * The code is **encrypted**, so a QR reader — or a photo of the code — shows nothing but base64.
 * Wire format, base64 over the whole thing:
 *
 *     [ 12-byte IV ][ AES-256-GCM ciphertext + 16-byte tag ]
 *
 * and the plaintext inside is the JSON below:
 *
 *     {"username":"PRIMA-COMMERCE\\filip","password":"…"}
 *
 * JSON rather than a delimited string because a Windows password may contain the very characters
 * a delimiter would have to reserve (`|`, `:`, `,`); splitting on one would truncate the password
 * into something that merely looks wrong at sign-in. The domain rides inside `username` exactly
 * as if typed — see `ExtSystemODataClient.buildClient`.
 *
 * GCM authenticates as well as encrypts, so a code made with a different key fails to decrypt
 * rather than yielding garbage credentials that would then fail confusingly against NAV.
 *
 * **What this does and doesn't protect.** The key travels in `ExtSystemConfig.loginQrKey`, which
 * means it sits both in the bundled defaults inside the APK and in the device's settings. So this
 * stops someone photographing or glancing at a printed code — the realistic exposure — but not
 * someone who unpacks the app or reads a provisioned device. Treat a printed code as sensitive
 * regardless. Rotating the key is an imported configuration, no new build, and it invalidates
 * every code issued under the old one.
