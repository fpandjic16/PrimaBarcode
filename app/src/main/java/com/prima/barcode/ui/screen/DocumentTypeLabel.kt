/**
 * The document type's name in the operator's language.
 *
 * `DocumentType.display` is the English constant the ERP and the logs use; this is what a person
 * reads. Every screen that shows a type needs it, and each of the seven that did had grown its own
 * private copy of exactly these lines — which is not merely duplication: the eighth screen could
 * not call any of them, and adding a type meant finding all seven.
